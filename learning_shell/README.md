# learning_shell
Since 2010, I write shell 6 years. But I always write simple shell for ios develping, such as copy, cd, mv, svn, git,scp, ssh. So I read the book to study how to write function programming with shell. It's usefull, but easy to forget, after long time no use. So write some demo, to recall memeory key.

Good luck!
